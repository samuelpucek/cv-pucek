    \begin{rSubsection}{Avast Software}{\em Prague, Czech Republic}{Data Scientist}{Jan 2022 - Present}
        \item Retention \& Loyalty
        
        I work on development and productionalisation of Machine Learning pipelines and models which are part of the retention strategy.

        \item Experimentation Platform (A/B Testing Platform)
        \item Data Quality
        
        I focused exclusively on further development of Experimentation Platform, mainly on automation of Data Quality Checks. Next I provided deep-dive analyses to answer questions related to personalization and further evangelized experimentation mindset across the organization.

    \begin{rSubsection}{Avast Software}{\em Prague, Czech Republic}{Junior Data Analyst}{Sep 2019 - Dec 2020}
        \item Experimentation Platform (A/B Testing Platform)
        \item Data Engineering
        
        My responsibility was to maintain and update data pipelines, create dozens of ad-hoc analyses (Jupyter Notebooks) to answer business-related questions, and to co-work on development of Avast's Experimentation Platform - the cutting-edge tool for automatic evaluation of experiments (A/B tests).
        
        My main contribution to Experimentation Platform was to design a statistical engine for evaluating experiments, which consists of sequential evaluation, multiple comparison problem, delta methods etc. The solution has been open-sourced in fall 2020 - feel free to check Avast GitHub repository \href{https://github.com/avast/ep-stats}{\texttt{ep-stats}}. From \texttt{ep-stats} we created an independent Python package which can be found in \href{https://pypi.org/project/ep-stats/}{PyPi}.
        
        In \texttt{ep-stats} we mainly focused on computational complexity. Using \texttt{numpy} we vectorized many math operations. We back-upped all features using unit testing, including statistical features stated above.

%    Projects And Seminars
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{rSection}{Projects}
% {\bf Mini kiwi.com} \hfill {\em Jun 2019}\\
% I took part on Python Weekend in Bratislava organized by kiwi.com. General topic was to create a~web application for searching ground connections (buses and trains). User fill web application parameters, choose source and destination city and date. The program will search all available connections. Offered journeys may contain multiple operators, e.g. FlixBus, České dráhy, RegioJet,~... We were dealing with both front and back end. We literally started on a greenfield. Schedules were gained from operators web pages via various requests and apis. Redis was used for optimization. All data were stored in SQL database for later re-usage. The whole project was coded in Python 3.6.\\
{\bf Discrete simulation of music festival} \hfill {\em Feb 2019}\\
The simulation was coded in C\#, with focus on user-friendly interface.\\
User can choose number of visitors, service speed (e.g. beer, hot-dog, toilets), and couple of other parameters. Program itself randomly creates visitors with various preferences and their own music schedule. Then the simulation starts. Randomness is also included in decisions during the simulation. The output is the overall satisfaction of visitors and detailed history of all visitors.\\
\\{\bf Modeling mortgage rates} \hfill {\em Oct 2018 - Jan 2019}\\
This project aimed at developing a framework for predicting mortgage rates for the purpose of actuarial cash flow models implemented in insurance company. We suggested multiple approaches, i.e. vector autoregression, simple regression. Bootstrap algorithm was used for generating scenarios. In addition, we dealt with client specific data of the insurance company. We used R and EViews for regression. Bootstrap and simulations were made in MATLAB. Client specific data were analysed in R.\\
\\{\bf Primary school timetable} \hfill {\em Aug 2018}\\
I used the results obtained in my Bachelor thesis and implemented them in real-life problem. Using GAMS I solved large linear optimization problem, which covered all requirements and conditions. The output was optimal timetable for the upcoming academic year. R was used for dealing with data before, and after the optimization.
